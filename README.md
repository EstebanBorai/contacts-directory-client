> Contacts Directory

## Motivation
Use .NET Core to create a WebAPI.

## Architecture
ContactsDirectory app uses a client made with React.js with a server made with .NETCore which connects to a SQLite database.
The client side interacts with the server through HTTP requests and renders the UI based on the received data.
