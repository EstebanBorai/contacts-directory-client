### Motivation
Use .NET Core to create a WebAPI.

### Getting Started
```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# run development server
yarn start
```

### Architecture
Contacts app uses a client made with React.js with a server made with .NETCore which connects to a SQLite database.
The client side interacts with the server through HTTP requests and renders the UI based on the received data.
